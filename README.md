DLD Linux (Desktop Linux Distribution Linux) is an Ubuntu-based desktop operating system designed to provide a clean, efficient, and developer-focused environment. It removes unnecessary vendor-controlled components while preserving compatibility with the broader Ubuntu ecosystem.

## Why DLD Linux?

Users often ask:  
**“Why choose DLD Linux instead of standard Ubuntu?”**

DLD Linux offers a focused, transparent, and upstream-aligned alternative by eliminating restrictive or intrusive components included in Ubuntu:

1. **Removal of Canonical-Controlled Components**
   - Canonical’s strategic priorities have shifted toward cloud, IoT, and AI.
   - Ubuntu Desktop contains subscription-oriented messaging, such as Ubuntu Pro promotions.
   - Snap, Canonical’s controlled packaging format, is enforced by default.
   - The Ubuntu App Store heavily prioritizes Snap packages.
   - Applications like Firefox installed via `apt` are silently replaced with Snap versions.

   **DLD Linux removes Snap support, subscription promotions, and other vendor-specific mechanisms**, delivering a consistent and traditional Linux environment.

2. **Choice of Upstream Desktop Environments**
   - Ubuntu uses a heavily customized GNOME setup.
   - DLD Linux provides **three unmodified, upstream desktop environments** to maximize user choice and control.

## Desktop Environments

1. **KDE Plasma** — A modern, feature-rich, and highly customizable desktop environment.  
2. **GNOME** — A streamlined, workflow-driven environment designed for simplicity and efficiency.  
3. **Cinnamon** — A stable, lightweight desktop offering a familiar and traditional interface.
