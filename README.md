**DLD Linux** is an upstream-aligned, Snap-free, user-respecting Ubuntu-based Linux distribution created and maintained by the **Linux Distribution Foundation (LDF)**.  
It delivers a predictable, transparent system designed for developers who value control, clarity, and freedom from vendor lock-in.

## Overview

DLD Linux provides a clean Ubuntu-compatible environment without Snap, forced vendor integrations, or subscription prompts.

It focuses on:

- A **minimal, predictable** base system  
- **APT-only** package management  
- **Upstream, unmodified desktop environments**  
- **User autonomy** and transparent system behavior  
- **Developer-first defaults** and documentation  

DLD Linux makes only the changes required to remove Snap and maintain upstream consistency.
